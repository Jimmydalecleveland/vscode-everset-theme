# Everset - VS Code Dark Theme

### A theme optimized for JS/React, with colors inspired by forests during sunset. _(Italic version included for script fonts such as [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/), [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/), etc.)_

The idea driving this theme's creation was to have a clearer color separation between JSX and Javascript. I entertained the idea of having warmer tones for JSX and cooler for Javascript, and felt that the theme of a forest in sunset would be a fun challenge to create.

I personally enjoy subtle color variations in my themes, but if you're looking for a dark theme with a focus on accessibility, I'd recommend Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) as an alternative.

**Update**: With the release of 1.0.0, We are finally done with the major changes to the color theme. It was tricky to add diversity to the "cool" colors side, but we've finally settled on a set we are happy with. If you are unhappy with the changes let me know, and if there is enough interest in keeping the original "cool" colors, I'll consider add a "classic" theme with them.

## Features

- Sidebar colors to match editor (this really should be the default, but since so many themes lack this I'm calling it a feature).
- Warmer tones for Classes, Components and JSX/html, cooler tones for most Javascript except for the ocassional item needing more emphasis (e.g. `this`, `super`, etc.). The idea behind this is to be able to locate the render section quickly in larger files, as well as differentiate JSX and Javascript with less effort.
- Italic version for better support of italic script fonts (e.g. Operator Mono, Dank Mono, etc.)
