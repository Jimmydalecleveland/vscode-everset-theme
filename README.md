# Everset - VS Code Dark Theme
### A theme optimized for JS/React, with colors inspired by forests during sunset. *(Italic version included for script fonts such as [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles/), [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/), etc.)* 

The idea driving this theme's creation was to have a clearer color separation between JSX and Javascript. I entertained the idea of having warmer tones for JSX and cooler for Javascript, and felt that the theme of a forest in sunset would be a fun challenge to create. I'll continue fixing issues and adding more language support in the near future.

I personally enjoy subtle color variations in my themes, but if you're looking for a dark theme with a focus on accessibility, I'd recommend Sarah Drasner's [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) as an alternative.

*This is a work in progress and everything about the theme is subject to change before the first full version (i.e. 1.0.0).*

*The font used in the screenshot is [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/), for anyone interested.*

## Features
- Sidebar colors to match editor (this really should be the default, but since so many themes lack this I'm calling it a feature).
- Warmer tones for Classes, Components and JSX/html, cooler tones for most Javascript except for the ocassional item needing more emphasis (e.g. `this`, `super`, etc.). The idea behind this is to be able to locate the render section quickly in larger files, as well as differentiate JSX and Javascript with less effort.
- Italic version for better support of italic script fonts (e.g. Operator Mono, Dank Mono, etc.)
