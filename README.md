# Everset - VS Code Dark Theme
A theme optimized for JS/React, inspired by forest sunsets. This is a work in progress and everything about the theme is subject to change before the first full version (i.e. 1.0.0).

## Features
- Sidebar colors to match editor (this really should be the default, but since so many themes lack this I'm calling it a feature).
- Warmer tones for Classes, Components and JSX/html, cooler tones for most Javascript except for the ocassional item needing more emphasis (e.g. `this`, `super`, etc.). The idea behind this is to be able to locate the render section quickly in larger files, as well as differentiate JSX and Javascript with less effort.
